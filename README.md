#pagestore (working title)

a simple python/sqlite library for storing documents/page data
in a cache, so it can be full-text-searched easily.

(Designed for a static website, so you can generate static
pages from markdown, store the HTML as static pages for regular
hosting, and store this sqlite database and a simple CGI or similar
script on the host as well for search type functionality).
